# The Neubot project

[Neubot](https://neubot.nexacenter.org/) is an R&D project of the [Nexa Center for Internet & Society at Politecnico di Torino, Dept. of Computer and Control Engineering](https://nexa.polito.it/). It started in 2008 develop the [neubot computer program](https://github.com/neubot/neubot), and later was expanded to include all the network measurement activities carried out at Nexa Center.

This repository loosely keeps track of the high-level activities we work on in the context of this project. It is high level, may not be super updated, and is mainly used to compile Nexa Center's yearly reports.
